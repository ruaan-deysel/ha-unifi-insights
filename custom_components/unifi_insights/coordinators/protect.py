# Bounded auto-off for the event-derived motion/smart-detect/ring latch (see
# `_reconcile_stale_events`). Protect gives no delivery guarantee on the
# "end" frame that closes out a motion/smartDetect/ring event (a WS
# reconnect, a dropped frame, a network glitch can all lose it), and the
# `camera_motion`/`camera_*_detection` binary sensors turn ON purely from
# "start seen, end not yet seen" - so a missing "end" would otherwise latch
# them ON forever. In a home security system a permanently-ON motion sensor
# is worse than one that never fires: it destroys the signal and can trigger
# automations or wake people up endlessly.
#
# Five minutes is chosen as an order-of-magnitude safety margin: it is well
# above SCAN_INTERVAL_PROTECT (30s, so it never fires on ordinary poll
# jitter) and well above a realistic single continuous Protect motion/smart
# -detect/doorbell-ring event (typically seconds to low minutes), while
# still being short enough that a stuck sensor self-heals within single
# -digit minutes rather than staying wrong for hours. It is deliberately not
# tied to any one event type - see `_reconcile_stale_events`.

# How many consecutive polls the door-state preservation in
# `_should_preserve_cached_door_state` may keep a cached sensor state ahead
# of what REST reports before REST is allowed to win regardless. Without
# this bound, `_merge_preserved_door_state` copies the preserved timestamp
# back onto the dict written to `self.data`, so a REST response that never
# reports a timestamp (or a controller whose REST timestamp is stuck) makes
# the cache re-seed its own "I am newer" signal every poll - a permanent
# wedge, worse than the stale-read bug this preservation exists to fix.
MAX_DOOR_STATE_PRESERVE_POLLS: Final = 3

# Separate, more generous cap for branch 1 (WS-recency) of
# `_should_preserve_cached_door_state`, evaluated independently per
# door/motion/tamper/leak GROUP (see `_PRESERVED_SENSOR_STATE_FIELD_GROUPS`
# below). Branch 1 only fires for a group when the incoming WebSocket frame
# actually carried a field belonging to THAT group (see the gated per-group
# stamp in `_handle_device_update`), so in the ordinary case it is
# self-resolving: it cannot keep firing without genuine new state
# continuing to arrive. This bound exists as a safety net for the residual
# case where that keeps happening anyway (e.g. a device re-announcing the
# same state over WS every poll while REST's own report of that state never
# catches up). It is deliberately NOT the tight MAX_DOOR_STATE_PRESERVE_POLLS
# cap: a genuinely flapping door legitimately produces a real WS state frame
# on every single poll, and preserving WS in that case is *correct*, not a
# bug - reusing the 3-poll cap here would let a stale REST value win over
# live, currently-arriving WebSocket data during real activity, which is
# worse than the wedge this exists to prevent.
#
# Once a group's cap trips, `_sensor_ws_recency_latched` LATCHES it: REST
# keeps winning for that group on every subsequent poll - the per-group
# counter is not reset to let the cycle restart - until REST's own report
# actually agrees with the cached value (see `_group_state_agrees`). Without
# the latch, resetting to 0 on trip let a sustained condition (a real WS
# frame landing inside every fetch window while REST never reflects it) win
# the cache back for another MAX_WS_RECENCY_PRESERVE_POLLS polls, then lose
# it again for one poll, repeating forever - a 1-in-11 flip on contacts that
# drive auto-lock automations, not the one-time resolution the cap is meant
# to provide.

# one trailing follow-up, instead of one REST /sensors call per flap.
SENSOR_RECONNECT_DEBOUNCE_SECONDS: Final = 5.0

# Hard cap on how many times `async_refresh_sensors`'s owner loop may

# How many consecutive polls a device may be absent from its collection before

# irreversible - it drops the area assignment, entity customizations and any
# automation keyed on device_id - while the absence itself is ambiguous: the
# coordinator cannot tell "unadopted from Protect" from "omitted by a partial
# controller response" or "skipped by `get_all()` on a ValidationError". The
# grace window keeps the eviction, just no longer on the strength of a single
# poll. 3 polls is ~90s at SCAN_INTERVAL_PROTECT (30s).
MAX_CONSECUTIVE_MISSING_POLLS: Final = 3

# Envelope-only keys that must never leak from the raw top-level WebSocket
# frame into a merged device/event dict - see `_pick_field` and the

# Field names (both camelCase API aliases and snake_case attribute names)
# that identify a door/motion/tamper/leak *state* frame, as opposed to an
# ordinary telemetry frame (temperature, humidity, battery, signal, etc),
# grouped by which physical state they describe. Used as the SINGLE source
# of truth in two places that must never drift apart from each other, PER
# GROUP:
#   1. `_merge_preserved_door_state` - which fields get copied from the
#      cache back onto an incoming REST response, for each group branch 1
#      of `_should_preserve_cached_door_state` decided to preserve.
#   2. `_handle_device_update` - which incoming WebSocket sensor frames are
#      allowed to stamp `_sensor_last_ws_update[device_id][group]`, which in
#      turn gates branch 1 of `_should_preserve_cached_door_state` for that
#      SAME group.
#
# This used to be ONE set covering all four groups together. That let a
# WebSocket frame carrying only e.g. `isMotionDetected` (a UP-Sense shares
# one device id across door/motion/environment sensing, and motion at an
# entryway fires constantly) make branch 1 preserve - and because the merge
# then copied back ALL FOUR groups' fields together, one motion frame could
# suppress a genuinely newer REST door transition for a poll. Splitting the
# set per group means a frame that only touches one group can only ever
# gate and merge THAT group - the other three are decided purely by their
# own WebSocket activity (or, for the "door" group only, the timestamp
# -comparison branches 2/3 below). The never-drift-apart guarantee is now
# per group instead of global: (1) and (2) still can't disagree about what
# counts as a "door" frame, but a "door" frame and a "motion" frame can no
# longer be confused for each other the way one shared set allowed.

    Single normalization boundary for `_should_preserve_cached_door_state`,

    epoch-millisecond value once it round-trips through the `Sensor` model's
    `_coerce_epoch_millis` validator) and the cached side (which can be
    whatever type was written into `self.data` last - the WebSocket path in
    `_handle_device_update` merges raw JSON straight from the wire and
    bypasses pydantic entirely, so it is NOT guaranteed to already be an
    int).

    Handles:
    - `int`/`float`: epoch value in either seconds or milliseconds,
      disambiguated by `_MILLISECOND_EPOCH_THRESHOLD` (mirrors the model
      validator's own millisecond assumption for the int case).
    - `datetime`: aware instances convert via `.timestamp()`; naive
      instances are assumed UTC (the Protect controller does not appear to
      emit naive local time, but a naive value must not raise or silently
      compare against an aware one incorrectly).
    - `str`: parsed as ISO 8601 via `datetime.fromisoformat`.

    Returns `None` for `None`, `bool` (an `int` subclass - deliberately
    excluded so a stray `True`/`False` can't be misread as an epoch of 1/0),
    or any value that doesn't parse, so callers can treat "not comparable"
    uniformly rather than needing a matrix of isinstance branches per
    ordered pair (the bug this replaces: `_compare_timestamps` had no
    branch at all for e.g. `(int, datetime)`, which returned `None` and

        Determine which door/motion/tamper/leak field GROUPS to keep cached.

        Returns the subset of `_PRESERVED_SENSOR_STATE_FIELD_GROUPS` keys
        whose fields `_merge_preserved_door_state` should copy from the
        cache onto the incoming REST sensor dict, instead of letting REST's
        own value win. Evaluated independently per group so that a
        WebSocket frame carrying only one group's fields (e.g. a
        motion-only frame from a UP-Sense that shares one device id across
        door/motion/environment sensing) can only ever preserve THAT
        group - it can no longer suppress a genuinely newer REST
        transition on an unrelated group the way a single shared
        preservation decision used to.

        Branch 1 (WebSocket-recency) below is genuinely per-group: it reads
        `self._sensor_last_ws_update[sensor_id]`, which
        `_handle_device_update` only stamps for the specific group(s) a
        frame actually carried. Branches 2/3 (REST-vs-cache
        `openStatusChangedAt` timestamp comparison) have no equivalent
        signal for motion/tamper/leak - they only ever reasoned about the
        door group's own timestamp - so they can only ever contribute
        "door" to the returned set, exactly as before this method returned
        a single bool.

        Bounded by `MAX_DOOR_STATE_PRESERVE_POLLS` via
        `self._sensor_preserve_counts` for the door-timestamp branches:
        `_merge_preserved_door_state` copies the preserved timestamp back
        onto the dict written to `self.data["sensors"]`, so without a
        bound the cache would re-seed its own "I am newer" signal on every
        subsequent poll whenever REST never reports a timestamp, or
        reports one that never advances past the cache - a permanent
        wedge, worse than the stale-read bug this preservation exists to
        fix.

        The WebSocket-recency check (branch 1) is bounded separately, per
        group, by `MAX_WS_RECENCY_PRESERVE_POLLS` via
        `self._sensor_ws_recency_preserve_counts` - NOT the tighter
        `MAX_DOOR_STATE_PRESERVE_POLLS` used below - and additionally
        LATCHED via `self._sensor_ws_recency_latched` once a group's cap
        trips, so a sustained condition resolves once instead of flipping
        every `MAX_WS_RECENCY_PRESERVE_POLLS`-th poll. See both constants'
        docstrings for the full history of why an earlier, unbounded
        version of this branch wedged the cache, and why a naive bounded
        -but-not-latched version merely turned the wedge into a periodic
